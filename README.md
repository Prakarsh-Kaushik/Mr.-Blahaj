# Mr.-Blahaj
A Discord bot named - "Mr. Blahaj". This project was made as a hack for  SharkHacks3 [ 27th-29th August 2021]

I made and run this bot on repl.it in node.js. Uptimerobot was used to ping the bot every 5 minutes and keep it alive.

1. It will respond to words like "Blahaj", "BLAHAJ","Shark", "shark", "SHARK", "blahaj", "ikea shark", "IKEA SHARK", "Blahaj Gang", "BLAHAJ GANG", with some random text along with user name,
2. Typing $facts cmd would result in a random facts about shark/blahaj stored in list.
3. User can add a new fact by typing $add followed by the fact. [Eg. $add Blahaj is friendly]
4. Typing $inspire cmd would produce a random quote from an api by Mr.Blahaj bot
